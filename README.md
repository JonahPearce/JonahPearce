<h1> About me </h1>

HiðŸ‘‹,
I am Jonah Pearce a Computer Science student at Conestoga College who is always looking for new projects and new people to collaborate with.
Computer programming is something I knew I wanted to do since I was little when making modifications to games which encouraged me to take mod design courses at a young age.
I am currently seeking a co-op placement for summer 2022! I am eager to advance my skills and get real world experience in computer science.
